I'm thrilled to share with you a recent project I've been working on: Road Accident Analysis using Power BI! 📊🛣️

As a passionate data analyst, I embarked on this project to gain deeper insights into road accidents and contribute to accident prevention efforts.
Using Power BI, I collected and analyzed a vast amount of road accident data, considering factors such as location, time, weather conditions, road conditions,
amount of day light and vehicle types. The goal was to uncover patterns and identify areas for improvement in road safety.

Through interactive and visually appealing dashboards, I created a comprehensive overview of road accidents in UK, highlighting trends, hotspot areas,
and contributing factors. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, I was able to present the data in an intuitive and insightful manner.

This project has not only enhanced my data analysis skills but also reinforced my commitment to making a positive impact on road safety.
By drawing attention to crucial factors such as road infrastructure, driver education, and enforcement policies, I believe we can work towards reducing accidents and saving lives.
