The dashboard is designed to provide insights into the performance of car sales. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows stakeholders to quickly and easily access the information they need. The Car Sales Dashboard is built using Power bi and is designed to be updated with new data on a regular basis. The dashboard displays key metrics such as the number of units sold, total revenue, the make (variant), top 5 models by revenue, the market share for each variant, the sales of cars over the years, etc allowing users to understand how the business is performing overall. It gives dynamic results based on the selection of make (variant) at the top of the dashboard. We can either check the metrics by each variant or by all variants together in total
 🔍Following are business insights drawn from the data:
💲The revenue generated by Chevrolet is higher than any other variant.
 🎢 Sales trends by Jaguar and Hyundai are less throughout all the years when compared with other variants.
🚙 The highest revenue generated is from the SUV model (from all make) with $100M.
📉 Irrespective of the variant, the sales trend in the year 2021 is increased as compared to year 2020 with $71M
⚪ Overall, the sales was higher of Pale White colour as compared to other colours.
📱 Total sales is of $371.2M and car sold are 13.3K for both years out of which Austin City individually initiated a sell of $65M.
